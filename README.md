# Online-Qiiz-Maker-2
Online Quiz Maker is a web-based application developed during my CodSoft internship. It allows users to create, attempt, and evaluate quizzes interactively. Built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, the project focuses on user-friendly design, real-time scoring, and improved frontend development skills.
